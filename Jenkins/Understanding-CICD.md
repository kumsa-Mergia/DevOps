# Understanding CI/CD and Jenkins' Role in Software Development

## What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**, a practice that enables teams to deliver software applications faster and with fewer errors. It automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production.  

### Key Components of CI/CD:
1. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - Developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository.
   - Automated tests and builds are triggered to validate the code.
   - Helps identify bugs early in the development cycle.

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
   - Extends CI by automating the delivery of tested changes to a staging environment.
   - Requires manual approval for production deployment.

3. **Continuous Deployment:**
   - Automates the entire pipeline from integration to production deployment.
   - Eliminates manual approval, ensuring faster release cycles.
