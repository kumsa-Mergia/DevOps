# Understanding Terraform

## **What is Terraform?**
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows developers and operators to define and provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments using a declarative configuration language.

### Key Features of Terraform:
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, VMware, and more.
- **Declarative Syntax**: Define desired state, and Terraform handles the rest.
- **Execution Plans**: Preview changes before applying them.
- **State Management**: Keeps track of infrastructure state to detect drift.
- **Modularity**: Reuse configurations using modules.

### Why Use Terraform?
1. **Cross-Platform:** Manage infrastructure across different platforms.
2. **Scalable:** Handle small to large-scale environments.
3. **Team Collaboration:** Share configurations and collaborate easily.
