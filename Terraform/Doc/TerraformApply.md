# Terraform Apply: Deploying Your Infrastructure

**Terraform apply** is the command that actually deploys the infrastructure described in your Terraform configuration files. It takes the plan generated by `terraform plan` and executes the necessary changes to your target environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premises).

**Key Concepts:**

* **Plan:** The `terraform plan` command generates an execution plan, outlining the proposed changes to your infrastructure. This plan is crucial for understanding the impact of your Terraform configuration before making any actual changes.
* **State:** Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the current state of your infrastructure. This file is essential for subsequent `apply` operations.
* **Idempotency:** Terraform is idempotent, meaning running `terraform apply` multiple times with the same configuration should have no additional effect. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of unintended changes.

**How Terraform Apply Works:**

1. **Reads the Plan:** `terraform apply` reads the execution plan generated by `terraform plan`.
2. **Executes Changes:** It then executes the planned changes to your infrastructure, interacting with the appropriate cloud provider or other target environment.
3. **Updates State:** After successfully applying the changes, Terraform updates the state file to reflect the new state of your infrastructure.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Review the Plan:** Always carefully review the output of `terraform plan` before running `terraform apply`. This allows you to understand the scope of the changes and identify any potential issues.
* **Use with Caution:** Be cautious when using `terraform apply`. Once the changes are applied, they can be difficult to revert.
* **State Management:** Proper state management is crucial for successful Terraform operations. Store your state file securely and back it up regularly.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
terraform apply
