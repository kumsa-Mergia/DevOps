# Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
## **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

### What is IaC?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a methodology for managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than manual processes. This approach ensures:
- **Consistency**: Avoids configuration drift.
- **Automation**: Simplifies repetitive tasks.
- **Version Control**: Tracks infrastructure changes in code repositories.
- **Repeatability**: Enables identical environments to be created reliably.

### Benefits of IaC:
- **Speed**: Rapidly deploy infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Easily replicate environments.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduce human errors and manual interventions.
- **Collaboration**: Share and review configurations as code.

### Popular IaC Tools:
- **Terraform** (by HashiCorp)
- **AWS CloudFormation**
- **Ansible**
- **Pulumi**
