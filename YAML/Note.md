##### YAML Note
- Stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language
- It is a data serialization language like JSON, XML, not a substitute!
- It is a simple, text-based, human-readable language used to exchange data between people and computers. It works perfectly with almost all programming languages like Python, Go, JS, Java, etc.

- The main advantage of using YAML is readability and writability.
- Not a programming language. It is mostly used for configuration files that need to be easier for humans to read and for programs to process. Almost all programming languages have YAML libraries.
- Another benefit of YAML is its support of various data types like arrays, dictionaries, lists, etc.
- The file extension for YAML files is `.yml` or `.yaml`.
