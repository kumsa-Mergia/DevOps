# YAML Structure Guide

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard often used for configuration files and data exchange. This guide provides an overview of YAML structure, including its syntax, common features, and examples.

## Basic YAML Syntax

### Key-Value Pairs
YAML represents data as key-value pairs:

```yaml
key: value
```

### Indentation
- Use spaces, not tabs, for indentation.
- Indentation determines hierarchy and structure.

Example:

```yaml
parent:
  child: value
```

### Comments
Use `#` for comments:

```yaml
# This is a comment
key: value
```

## YAML Data Types

### Scalars
Scalars are simple values, such as strings, numbers, or booleans:

```yaml
string: "This is a string"
integer: 42
float: 3.14
boolean: true
```

### Lists
Lists are sequences of items. Use a dash (`-`) for each item:

```yaml
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - cherry
```

### Dictionaries (Mappings)
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs:

```yaml
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  address:
    city: New York
    zip: 10001
```

---

## Advanced YAML Features

### Multiline Strings
Multiline strings can be created using `|` (literal block) or `>` (folded block):

```yaml
literal_block: |
  This is a multiline
  string with preserved
  line breaks.

folded_block: >
  This is a multiline
  string without preserved
  line breaks.
```

### Anchors and Aliases
Re-use values using anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`):

```yaml
defaults: &defaults
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3

server:
  <<: *defaults
  host: example.com
```

### Tags
Explicitly declare data types using tags:

```yaml
number_as_string: !!str 42
```

## Example YAML File

```yaml
application:
  name: SampleApp
  version: 1.0.0
  features:
    - user_authentication
    - data_export
    - analytics

database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  credentials:
    username: admin
    password: secret

logging:
  level: debug
  file: /var/log/sampleapp.log
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Indentation:** Use 2 or 4 spaces, and avoid mixing them.
2. **Quotes:** Use quotes for strings containing special characters.
3. **Validation:** Use YAML validators to ensure correct syntax.
4. **Readability:** Keep the structure simple and well-documented.
