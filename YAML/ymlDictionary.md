# YAML Dictionary

A dictionary is a data structure that allows us to store data in key-value pairs. In YAML, dictionaries are represented as mappings. A mapping is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is mapped to a value.

## Basic Structure of YAML Dictionary

A YAML dictionary is defined using the following syntax:

```yaml
key: value
```
- `key` is the name or identifier.
- `value` is the data associated with that key.

## For example:
```yml
name: Kumsa Mergia
age: 25
city: Addis Ababa
```

## Conclusion

YAML dictionaries are a powerful and flexible way to represent structured data. Understanding how to define and use key-value pairs, including nested dictionaries and lists, is crucial for working with YAML in configuration files and data serialization.
