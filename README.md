## Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement aimed at enhancing collaboration between development and operations teams through automation and continuous improvement. In this section, you'll learn about the foundational concepts of DevOps and why it's critical to modern software development.

- **Key Concepts**: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Why DevOps?**: Understand how DevOps accelerates software delivery and improves system reliability.

**Resources**:
- [What is DevOps?](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/)
- [DevOps Overview](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devops)

## DevOps Principles and Practices

This section explores the core principles and practices of DevOps, focusing on collaboration, automation, and feedback loops. You'll also learn about the following key practices:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for automated provisioning
- **Monitoring** to ensure system health and performance

**Resources**:
- [DevOps Practices Overview](https://www.atlassian.com/devops)
- [Continuous Integration vs. Continuous Deployment](https://www.simplilearn.com/continuous-integration-vs-continuous-delivery-article)

## Setting Up DevOps Tools

To put theory into practice, you'll need to install and configure key DevOps tools. In this section, we'll walk through setting up Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins on your local or cloud environment.

**Tools to Install**:
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**: Containerization platform.
- **[Kubernetes (Minikube)](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)**: Orchestrator for containerized applications.
- **[Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)**: Infrastructure as Code tool.
- **[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)**: Automation tool for configuration management.
- **[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)**: Continuous Integration and Delivery tool.

## Containers and Docker

Learn about containers and how Docker revolutionizes application deployment and management. By the end of this section, you'll understand the role of containers in DevOps and how Docker simplifies the deployment process.

**Key Concepts**:
- Docker Images, Containers, Dockerfiles, Volumes, and Networking.

**Practice**:
- Build and deploy a web application inside a Docker container.

**Resources**:
- [Docker Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Dockerizing a Web Application](https://docker-curriculum.com/)

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications at scale. This section covers the Kubernetes architecture, key components, and how to set up a Kubernetes cluster.

**Key Topics**:
- Kubernetes Architecture: Master and Worker Nodes
- Pods, Deployments, Services, and Namespaces
- Kubernetes Networking (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

**Practice**:
- Deploy a multi-container application using Kubernetes.

**Resources**:

## Terraform

Terraform is a powerful tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). In this section, you'll learn how to provision, manage, and version your infrastructure using Terraform.

**Key Topics**:
- Terraform Configuration Language (HCL)
- Providers, Resources, Variables, Outputs
- State Management and Remote Backends

**Practice**:
- Write Terraform configurations to provision AWS infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances).
